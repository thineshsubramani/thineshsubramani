# Development Values & Standards

> **Note:** I am developing an automated scanning tool that will check all repositories under my name.  
> The tool will validate documentation standards, ensuring they follow specific formats and rules.  
> Only repositories that pass these checks will be certified as **Golden-Repo** (approved for release).

- **Independent, Modular, and Scalable**  
  All tools must be self-contained, easy to integrate, and designed to scale without major refactoring.

- **Standards Compliance**  
  Enforce strict naming conventions, consistent formatting, and industry best practices for maintainability.

- **Workflow is Must**  
  Replace repetitive manual tasks with streamlined, end-to-end automation, ideally single-click execution.

- **Clear Documentation**  
  Maintain concise, well-structured, and standardized documentation for easy onboarding and reference.

- **Defined Lifecycles**  
  Establish clear development stages and states for every tool and project to ensure transparency and control.
